# Automated-Distribution-Map-Plotting
Scripts to automate plotting of species observations using OS Grid 10km squares

These scripts are modifed off of code written by Stuart Ball in his Vimeo turtorials (https://vimeo.com/user105997307). 

Here I automate the process allowing for ease in distribution map plotting by iterating over an entire dataset of different species.

The first script works on the public BWARS data set available here: https://www.bwars.com/content/bwars-data-download
