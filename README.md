# Automated-Distribution-Map-Plotting
R scripts to automate plotting of species observations/occurances using OS Grid 10km squares.

These scripts are modifed from code written by Stuart Ball in his Vimeo turtorials (https://vimeo.com/user105997307). 

Here I automate the process allowing for ease in distribution map plotting by iterating over an entire dataset of different species.

The R script dist_plot_script_standard.R works on the public BWARS data set available here: https://www.bwars.com/content/bwars-data-download

The second R script, dist_plot_NBN_script.R, works on downloadable occurance data from BRC/NBN (https://www.brc.ac.uk/theme/datasets?fbclid=IwAR0w_FOuX2qQCKBNV4bggsseMgKBbWiyAtRggNkI7jsEY6wSieObqu6jKc0)

Example map - plots are very customisable
